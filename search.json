In the two-plus years since, China has refused to condemn the invasion and helped Russia acquire materiel, from machine tools to engines to drones, crucial for the war effort. The flourishing partnership between Xi and Putin has raised serious questions in Western capitals. Is the alliance that linked Moscow and Beijing in the early Cold War back? The Russians and the Chinese have repeatedly dismissed such talk, but they have also asserted that their current partnership is more resilient than the days when they led the communist world together. 2022年2月4日，就在入侵乌克兰前夕，俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京前往北京，与中国领导人习近平签署了一份宣称“无上限”伙伴关系的文件。在随后的两年多里，中国拒绝谴责这次入侵，并帮助俄罗斯获取从机床到发动机再到无人机等对战争努力至关重要的物资。习近平与普京之间蓬勃发展的伙伴关系在西方各国首都引发了严重质疑。冷战初期将莫斯科和北京联系在一起的联盟又回来了？俄罗斯和中国多次驳斥这种说法，但他们也断言，目前的伙伴关系比他们曾一起领导共产主义世界的时代更加坚韧。 Xi would know. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a high-level Chinese Communist Party (CCP) official whose own career was a microcosm of relations between Beijing and Moscow during the twentieth century, from the early days of the revolution in the 1920s and 1930s to the on-and-off help during the 1940s and the wholesale copying of the Soviet model in the 1950s, and from the open split of the 1960s and 1970s to the rapprochement in the late 1980s. The elder Xi’s dealings with Moscow showed the dangers of intimacy and enmity, how growing too close created unmanageable tensions that produced a costly feud. Understanding that history, the younger Xi by all appearances believes that the current relationship between Moscow and Beijing is indeed stronger than it was in the 1950s, and that he can avoid the strains that led to the earlier split. 习近平深知这一点。他的父亲习仲勋是中国共产党高级官员，他的职业生涯是二十世纪中苏关系的缩影，从20世纪20年代和30年代革命初期，到40年代的断断续续的援助，再到50年代对苏联模式的全面复制，从60年代和70年代的公开决裂到80年代末的和解。习仲勋与莫斯科的交往显示了亲密和敌意的危险，过于亲近会导致难以管理的紧张局势，从而引发代价高昂的争斗。了解这段历史，习近平显然认为目前的中俄关系确实比50年代更强，他可以避免导致先前分裂的压力。 During the Cold War communist ideology ultimately pushed the two countries apart, while now they are united by a more general set of conservative, anti-Western, and statist attitudes. In the old days, poor relations between individual leaders damaged the relationship, while today, Xi and Putin have made their personal connection a feature of the strategic partnership. Then, the exigencies of the Cold War alliance, which required each side to sacrifice its own interests for the other’s, contained the seeds of its own demise, whereas the current axis of convenience allows more flexibility. China and Russia will never again march in lockstep as they did in the first years after the Chinese Revolution, but they won’t walk away from each other any time soon. 在冷战期间，共产主义意识形态最终将两国分裂，而现在他们则因更广泛的保守、反西方和国家主义态度而团结。在过去，领导人之间糟糕的关系损害了两国关系，而今天，习近平和普京把他们的个人联系作为战略伙伴关系的一部分。那时，冷战联盟的紧迫性要求双方为对方牺牲自己的利益，这也埋下了它自己毁灭的种子，而现在的便利轴心则允许更多的灵活性。中俄永远不会像中国革命初期那样步调一致，但他们也不会很快分道扬镳。 DANGEROUS LIAISONS 危险的关系Xi Jinping was born in 1953, at the height of China’s feverish copying of the Soviet Union. The most popular slogan in China that year: “The Soviet Union of today is the China of tomorrow.” Xi Zhongxun had just moved to Beijing from China’s northwest, where he had spent most of the first four decades of his life fighting in a revolution inspired by the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Like so many of his generation, Xi was devoted to the cause despite numerous setbacks and personal sacrifices—a devotion that survived his persecution and incarceration by fellow members of the CCP in 1935 for not adhering closely enough to communist orthodoxy. 习近平出生于1953年，正值中国热衷于效仿苏联的巅峰时期。当年中国最流行的口号是：“今天的苏联就是明天的中国。”习仲勋刚从中国西北迁到北京，他在西北度过了大部分人生的前四十年，参加了受到1917年布尔什维克革命启发的革命。和他那一代的许多人一样，尽管经历了无数挫折和个人牺牲，习对这项事业始终忠诚——这种忠诚使他在1935年因未能严格遵循共产主义正统而被党内同志迫害和监禁后仍未动摇。 The Bolshevik victory influenced early Chinese radicals, and Moscow led and bankrolled the CCP in its early years. But the growing independence of the Chinese Communists went hand in hand with the rise of Mao Zedong—and tied Xi Zhongxun’s fate to Mao’s. In Mao’s narrative, Soviet-trained radicals had almost buried the revolution in China because they had failed to understand the country’s special conditions. These dogmatists, Mao claimed, had persecuted Xi in 1935 just as they had mistreated Mao himself earlier that decade, when Mao was sidelined by Soviet-aligned leaders in the CCP. 布尔什维克的胜利影响了早期的中国激进分子，莫斯科在中共早期领导和资助了该党。但中国共产党日益增长的独立性与毛泽东的崛起密不可分，并将习仲勋的命运与毛的命运联系在一起。根据毛的说法，苏联训练的激进分子几乎使中国革命夭折，因为他们未能理解中国的特殊情况。毛声称，这些教条主义者在1935年迫害了习，就像他们在本世纪早些时候冷落毛自己一样，当时毛被党内亲苏领导人排挤。 Xi and Putin have made their personal connection a feature of the strategic partnership.习近平和普京已将他们的个人联系作为战略伙伴关系的一部分。 Nonetheless, Mao was not advocating a break from Moscow. Xi Zhongxun met very few foreigners for most of his early life, but that changed in the late 1940s, as the Communists swept across China during the country’s civil war. He started having sustained interactions with Soviets as the head of the enormous Northwest Bureau, the party organization that oversaw the Xinjiang region. The Soviet Union helped the CCP project military power there, and in December 1949, after the Communists had won the war and consolidated control over mainland China, Xi successfully proposed to the party’s leaders that Xinjiang and the Soviet Union cooperate to develop resources in the province. A year later, Xi became head of the Northwest Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association. 尽管如此，毛并不主张与莫斯科决裂。习仲勋在早年生活中很少接触外国人，但这种情况在1940年代末发生了变化，随着共产党人在国内战争中席卷中国，他开始与苏联人进行持续互动。作为监督新疆地区的庞大西北局的负责人，他开始与苏联人频繁接触。苏联帮助中共在那里投射军事力量，1949年12月，在共产党赢得战争并巩固对中国大陆的控制后，习成功向党的领导人提议，新疆与苏联合作开发该省资源。一年后，习成为西北中苏友好协会的负责人。 Right around the time of Xi Jinping’s birth, the CCP undertook its first great purge—an incident closely linked to both the Soviet Union and the Xi family. Gao Gang, a high-level official who was seen as a potential successor to Mao, went too far in his criticisms of other leaders during private conversations. Mao turned on his protégé, and Gao eventually committed suicide. Gao had close ties to Moscow, and although they were not the reason for his purge at the time, Mao came to worry about such connections and concluded that they amounted to treachery. The danger of close relations with a foreign power, even an ally, could not have been lost on Xi Zhongxun, who had served alongside Gao in the northwest and had been persecuted along with him in 1935. Xi nearly fell along with him. 就在习近平出生前后，中共进行了第一次大清洗——这一事件与苏联和习家族密切相关。高级官员高岗在私下谈话中对其他领导人批评过度，被视为毛的潜在接班人。毛转而反对他的门徒，高最终自杀。高与莫斯科关系密切，尽管这不是他被清洗的原因，但毛开始担心这种关系，并认为这相当于背叛。与外国势力的密切关系，甚至是盟友，不可能没有让习仲勋意识到危险。习曾在西北与高一起工作，1935年也与高一起被迫害。习差点和高一起倒下。 Although Xi Zhongxun’s career was hurt by Gao’s misfortune, he was later put in charge of managing the tens of thousands of Soviet experts sent to help China rebuild after years of war. That was no easy task. As Xi recounted in a 1956 speech, these experts had a hard time acclimating to China, and some of them had “died, been poisoned, been injured, gotten sick, and robbed”—even suicide was a problem. When Mao decided that same year that the Chinese political structure was too “Soviet” and concentrated too much authority in Beijing, Xi was also tasked by the leadership to devise a government-restructuring plan. 尽管高的厄运损害了习仲勋的职业生涯，但后来他负责管理数万名帮助中国重建的苏联专家。这并非易事。正如习在1956年的一篇演讲中所回忆的那样，这些专家很难适应中国，有些人“死亡、中毒、受伤、生病、被抢劫”——甚至自杀也是个问题。同年，当毛决定中国的政治结构过于“苏联化”并将过多权力集中在北京时，习也被领导层委托制定政府重组计划。 SPLITTING UP 分道扬镳In August and September 1959, Xi, then a powerful vice premier, led a delegation to the Soviet Union. The timing was inopportune. In June, the Soviets had reneged on a promise to support China’s nuclear weapons program. Xi was supposed to visit the Soviet Union earlier in the summer of that year, but a CCP plenum in Lushan—where Minister of Defense Peng Dehuai was purged—shattered those plans. Peng had written a letter to Mao criticizing the Great Leap Forward, and Mao not only interpreted Peng’s act as a personal affront but also suspected, incorrectly, that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had put him up to it. Peng and Xi were linked by career ties forged on the battlefield for northwest China. The CCP’s second great purge, just like the first, was both proximate to the Xi family and tied to Mao’s suspicions of Soviet intentions. And once again, Xi only narrowly survived. 1959年8月和9月，时任副总理的习仲勋率领代表团访问苏联。时机并不合适。6月，苏联违背了承诺，不再支持中国的核武器计划。习本应在当年夏初访问苏联，但中共中央在庐山召开的全会——在会上国防部长彭德怀被清洗——打乱了这一计划。彭德怀给毛泽东写了一封信，批评大跃进，毛不仅将彭的行为视为个人冒犯，还错误地怀疑苏联领导人尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫指使了彭。彭和习在西北战场上建立了职业关系。中共的第二次大清洗，与第一次一样，与习家族紧密相关，并与毛对苏联意图的怀疑有关。而习再次勉强幸存下来。 Since 1956, Sino-Soviet tensions had been growing gradually behind the scenes, but they broke out publicly during Xi’s trip. On August 25, the same day the Soviet embassy in Beijing invited Xi on his visit, Chinese soldiers killed one Indian soldier and wounded another on the Chinese-Indian border. Although the Chinese concluded that the deaths were accidental, the Soviets were incensed, because they believed that the violence would push the Indians away from the communist bloc and frustrate Khrushchev’s attempts to achieve détente with the West during an upcoming trip to Washington. 自1956年以来，中苏紧张关系逐渐在幕后加剧，但在习的访问期间公开爆发。8月25日，就在苏联大使馆邀请习访问的同一天，中国士兵在中印边境打死了一名印度士兵，打伤了另一名。尽管中国认为死亡是意外的，但苏联人非常愤怒，因为他们认为这种暴力会将印度人推离共产主义阵营，并挫败赫鲁晓夫在即将到来的华盛顿之行中实现缓和的努力。 Arriving in Moscow two days after the violence on the border, Xi did his best to affirm the alliance. In a private meeting with a Soviet vice premier, he tried to put a positive spin on Mao’s Great Leap Forward, then one year in. He visited the Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, a showcase for Soviet technological triumphs, and placed a wreath at the mausoleum of the Soviet Union’s first two leaders, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. After spending a few days in Soviet Ukraine and Czechoslovakia, Xi returned to Moscow, where his delegation toured Lenin’s old office and apartment in the Grand Kremlin Palace. He apparently told his son about the moment: in 2010, when Xi Jinping visited Moscow as vice president, he asked Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to take him to the same room. According to a well-connected Russia expert, Xi lingered there, telling Medvedev that this was the cradle of Bolshevism. His father, Xi claimed, had said that Russia and China should always be friends. 在边境暴力事件发生两天后抵达莫斯科，习尽力确认联盟。在与苏联副总理的私人会议上，他试图对毛的一年多的“大跃进”进行积极解读。他参观了国民经济成就展览馆，一个展示苏联技术成就的地方，并在苏联的两位首任领导人弗拉基米尔·列宁和约瑟夫·斯大林的陵墓前献了花。在苏联乌克兰和捷克斯洛伐克呆了几天后，习返回莫斯科，他的代表团参观了列宁在克里姆林宫大厦的旧办公室和公寓。他显然将这一时刻告诉了他的儿子：2010年，当习近平以副主席身份访问莫斯科时，他请俄罗斯总统德米特里·梅德韦杰夫带他去同一个房间。根据一位消息灵通的俄罗斯专家的说法，习近平在那里流连，告诉梅德韦杰夫这是布尔什维克主义的摇篮。他声称，他的父亲曾说，俄罗斯和中国应该永远是朋友。 Putin and Xi attending an official welcoming ceremony in Beijing, May 2024 普京和习近平在2024年5月出席北京的官方欢迎仪式 Sergei Bobylev / Reuters 谢尔盖·鲍勃列夫 / 路透社 Yet in 1959, Xi Zhongxun was in the middle of a crisis in the relationship. On September 9, back in Beijing, Soviet diplomats informed the Chinese about plans to publish a statement in TASS, the state-owned news agency, that took a neutral position on the Chinese-Indian border skirmish. The Chinese were furious and asked the Soviets to change or delay the bulletin. The Soviets not only refused their request but published the statement that evening. Xi left for Beijing the very next day—even though he was supposed to continue leading the delegation until September 18. When Mao and Khrushchev met the following month, Mao complained about the incident, saying, “The TASS announcement made all imperialists happy.” 然而在1959年，习仲勋正处于关系危机的中心。9月9日，回到北京，苏联外交官通知中国计划在国营新闻机构塔斯社发表声明，对中印边境冲突采取中立立场。中国人大为恼火，要求苏联修改或推迟公告。苏联不仅拒绝了他们的要求，还在当晚发表了声明。习第二天就离开了北京——尽管他原本应继续带领代表团直到9月18日。毛和赫鲁晓夫下个月会晤时，毛抱怨此事，说：“塔斯社的声明让所有帝国主义者都高兴。” The dispute was merely the first public crack in the alliance. In the summer of 1960, Khrushchev removed all Soviet experts from China, and Xi was placed in charge of managing their departure. The lesson his son drew from the episode was that the Chinese needed to rely on themselves. At a November 2022 meeting in Bali, according to a former senior U.S. diplomat, Xi Jinping told U.S. President Joe Biden that American technological restrictions would fail, pointing out that the Soviets’ cessation of technological cooperation had not prevented China from developing its own nuclear weapons. 这场争端仅仅是联盟首次公开裂痕。1960年夏天，赫鲁晓夫撤回了所有在华苏联专家，习负责管理他们的撤离。他的儿子从这次事件中得出的教训是，中国需要依靠自己。根据一位前美国高级外交官的说法，2022年11月在巴厘岛的一次会议上，习近平告诉美国总统乔·拜登，美国的技术限制将失败，并指出苏联停止技术合作并未阻止中国发展自己的核武器。 HOT AND COLD 冷与热In 1962, Xi Zhongxun’s luck ran out, and he was expelled from power in the CCP’s third great purge. Just like Gao and Peng, he was accused of spying for the Soviet Union, although that was not the primary reason for his punishment. Mao had decided that China, like the Soviet Union before it, was losing its fixation on class struggle, and Xi was caught up in destruction that Mao wrought in reaction. In 1965, while Mao was planning a costly reorganization of Chinese society to fight a possible war against the Soviet Union or the United States, Xi was exiled from Beijing to a mining machinery factory hundreds of miles away in the city of Luoyang. Ironically, that factory had been completed with the help of Soviet experts and had even been described in a local newspaper as a “crystallization” of the “glorious Sino-Soviet friendship.” 1962年，习仲勋的好运用尽，在中共第三次大清洗中被驱逐出权力。像高岗和彭德怀一样，他被指控为苏联间谍，尽管这并不是他受罚的主要原因。毛泽东认为中国像之前的苏联一样，正在失去对阶级斗争的专注，习因此卷入了毛反应中所带来的破坏。1965年，当毛计划进行一场代价高昂的社会重组，以应对可能与苏联或美国的战争时，习被流放到几百英里外洛阳的一家矿山机械厂。讽刺的是，这家工厂是在苏联专家的帮助下建成的，甚至被当地报纸称为“光辉的中苏友谊的结晶”。 All told, Xi Zhongxun spent 16 years in the political wilderness. He had to wait until 1978, two years after Mao’s death, to be rehabilitated. As party boss of the province of Guangdong, Xi warned Americans that they needed to be strong to ward off Soviet aggression. On a trip to the United States in 1980, he impressed his U.S. counterparts with his anti-Soviet views and even made a trip to the headquarters of the North American Air Defense Command, or NORAD, in Colorado, where he took copious notes. As the Politburo member charged with managing relations with foreign parties that were revolutionary, leftist, or communist in nature, Xi helped lead Beijing’s competition for influence with Moscow throughout the world. He also managed Tibetan affairs, and in the first half of the 1980s, he worried about Soviet influence over the Dalai Lama. But by 1986, as ties thawed, Xi was praising the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and expressing hope for improved relations. 总而言之，习仲勋在政治荒野中度过了16年。直到毛泽东去世两年后的1978年，他才得以恢复名誉。作为广东省委书记，习警告美国人，他们需要保持强大以抵御苏联的侵略。1980年访问美国期间，他以反苏观点给美国同行留下深刻印象，甚至访问了位于科罗拉多州的北美防空司令部（NORAD）总部，并做了大量笔记。作为负责与具有革命性、左翼或共产主义性质的外国党派关系的政治局成员，习帮助领导了北京在全球范围内与莫斯科的影响力竞争。他还管理西藏事务，在80年代上半期，他担心苏联对达赖喇嘛的影响。但到1986年，随着关系解冻，习赞扬苏联领导人米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫的改革，并表达了改善关系的希望。 What did Xi Jinping make of this history? In 2013, on his first overseas trip after becoming top leader, he went to Russia, where he spoke warmly to a group of Sinologists about his father’s 1959 visit. The pictures from that journey had been destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, he said, but his mother kept the gifts from it. Xi explained that although many observers believed that his generation was oriented toward the West, he was raised reading two literatures, Chinese and Russian. After Xi was exiled to the countryside as a “sent-down youth” during the Cultural Revolution, he spent his days reading Russian revolutionary novels, with a favorite being What Is to Be Done? by Nikolay Chernyshevsky. Xi later claimed to like the character Rakhmetov, the revolutionary fanatic who slept on nails to forge his will. Claiming inspiration, Xi said he wandered through rainstorms and blizzards during his time in the countryside. 习近平如何看待这段历史？2013年，在他成为最高领导人后的首次出访中，他前往俄罗斯，并热情地向一群汉学家讲述了他父亲1959年的访问。他说，那次旅程的照片在文革期间被毁，但他母亲保留了那些礼物。习解释说，尽管许多观察家认为他那一代人面向西方，但他是在阅读中俄两国文学中成长的。文革期间，习作为“下乡青年”被流放到农村时，他花时间阅读俄国革命小说，其中最喜欢的是尼古拉·车尔尼雪夫斯基的《怎么办？》。习后来声称喜欢革命狂热者拉赫梅托夫这个角色，拉赫梅托夫为了锻炼意志力在钉子上睡觉。受其启发，习说他在乡下时曾在暴风雨和暴风雪中徘徊。 But in his 2013 talk with the Russian Sinologists, he did not mention the dismal state of Sino-Soviet relations at the time of his Russian reading. In 1969, the year he was sent to the countryside, China and the Soviet Union were fighting an undeclared border war, and there were even fears of a Soviet nuclear attack. Nor did he tell them about his first job after graduating university, working as a secretary to Geng Biao, secretary-general of the Central Military Commission. Geng viewed Moscow warily. In 1980, at a meeting in Beijing, U.S. Secretary of Defense Harold Brown told Geng that when it came to the two sides’ views on the Soviet Union, “it seems to me, our respective staffs must have written our talking papers together.” 但在2013年与俄罗斯汉学家的谈话中，他没有提及他阅读俄国小说时中苏关系的惨淡状态。1969年，他被下放到农村时，中苏正在进行一场未宣战的边境战争，甚至有人担心苏联会进行核攻击。他也没有提到他大学毕业后的第一份工作，是担任中央军委秘书长耿飚的秘书。耿对莫斯科持谨慎态度。1980年，在北京的一次会议上，美国国防部长哈罗德·布朗告诉耿，在双方对苏联的看法上，“在我看来，我们各自的工作人员仿佛是一起写了我们的谈话稿。” THE IDEOLOGICAL IRRITANT 意识形态的刺激Given the state of relations among Russia, China, and the United States today, it is hard to imagine that Xi Jinping spent part of his teenage years digging an air-raid shelter in preparation for a possible Soviet attack—or for that matter, that his father had been invited to see NORAD. The fluidity of the Washington-Beijing-Moscow triangle over the last 75 years has led some to hope that Xi might somehow be convinced to rein in his support for Russia. But those wishing for a redux of the Sino-Soviet split are likely to be disappointed. 鉴于今天俄罗斯、中国和美国之间的关系，很难想象习近平在少年时代曾挖掘防空洞，以准备应对可能的苏联攻击——更不用说他父亲曾被邀请参观北美防空司令部。华盛顿-北京-莫斯科三角关系在过去75年的流动性让一些人希望，习近平可能会被说服限制对俄罗斯的支持。但那些期待中苏分裂重演的人可能会失望。 For one thing, the irritant of ideology is now mostly absent from the relationship. It is true that a common communist ideology served as an extraordinary glue for China and Russia in the years immediately after 1949. But as time went on, ideology actually made it harder for the two countries to manage their differences. Mao had a habit of interpreting tactical differences as deeper ideological disputes. The Soviets, Mao increasingly came to believe, did not support China’s combative position toward the West because they had gone “revisionist.” And among communists, charges of theoretical heresy were explosive. When Mao and Khrushchev fought over the TASS announcement in October 1959, it was Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi’s claim that the Soviets were “time-servers” that especially enraged Khrushchev, as it questioned his communist credentials by painting him as a traitor to the revolutionary enterprise. There is a lot of truth, then, to the historian Lorenz Luthi’s claim that “without the vital role of ideology, neither would the alliance have been established nor would it have collapsed.” 首先，意识形态的刺激现在大多已经不在这种关系中。确实，共同的共产主义意识形态在1949年后不久成为中国和俄罗斯之间一种非凡的纽带。但随着时间的推移，意识形态实际上使两国更难以处理分歧。毛习惯将战术分歧解读为更深层的意识形态争议。毛越来越认为，苏联人不支持中国对西方的对抗立场，因为他们已经变得“修正主义”。在共产党内部，理论异端的指控是爆炸性的。1959年10月，毛与赫鲁晓夫因塔斯社声明争执时，正是中国外交部长陈毅声称苏联人是“见风使舵”的言论激怒了赫鲁晓夫，因为这质疑了他的共产主义信条，将其描绘为革命事业的叛徒。因此，历史学家洛伦茨·卢西的说法有很多真相，即“没有意识形态的关键作用，这个联盟既不会建立，也不会瓦解。” Chinese and Russian elites consider democracy promotion an existential threat.中俄精英认为民主推广是对其生存的威胁。 Moreover, once ideological differences entered the equation, it became hard to talk about anything else, in part because debates over ideology could imply calls for regime change. In 1971, after a relatively productive conversation with two Soviet diplomats, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai exploded when one of them raised the issue of a People’s Daily article that they believed called for the Soviet people to start a revolution. Zhou noted that the Soviet Union was hosting Wang Ming, an early CCP leader who had clashed with Mao and been effectively exiled. “You think that we fear him,” Zhou said. “He is worse than shit!” When one Soviet diplomat asked a Chinese participant to stop yelling, saying “a shout is not an argument,” the Chinese diplomat fired back: “If not for shouting, you will not listen.” 此外，一旦意识形态分歧进入讨论范围，就很难再谈其他事情，部分原因是关于意识形态的辩论可能暗示对政权更迭的呼吁。1971年，在与两名苏联外交官进行相对富有成效的对话后，中国总理周恩来在其中一人提到《人民日报》的一篇文章时勃然大怒，他们认为该文章呼吁苏联人民发动革命。周指出，苏联正在接待早期中共领导人王明，王曾与毛发生冲突并被有效流放。“你们以为我们怕他，”周说，“他比屎还糟！”当一名苏联外交官要求一名中国参与者停止喊叫，说“喊叫不是争论”时，中国外交官回击道：“如果不喊，你们就不会听。” Today’s Russia, however, is distant from the ideals of communism, to put it mildly. Although Putin once called the collapse of the Soviet Union a “geopolitical catastrophe,” he has often revealed rather negative views of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In his speech on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he blamed Lenin for creating modern Ukraine and spoke of Stalin’s “dictatorship” and “totalitarian regime.” Xi Jinping, on the other hand, continues to take communism’s legacy seriously. According to an Australian diplomat, Russian diplomats found it odd when, on one occasion, Xi quoted to them the Russian revolutionary novel How the Steel Was Tempered. Although not a dogmatist, Xi cares deeply about ideology and has even blamed the collapse of the Soviet Union in part on Moscow’s failure to ensure that people took Marxism-Leninism seriously. 然而，今天的俄罗斯，与共产主义理想相去甚远。尽管普京曾称苏联解体是“地缘政治灾难”，但他经常透露对苏联共产党的负面看法。在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰前夕的演讲中，他指责列宁创造了现代乌克兰，并谈到斯大林的“独裁”和“极权政权”。另一方面，习近平继续认真对待共产主义遗产。根据一位澳大利亚外交官的说法，俄罗斯外交官发现，当习近平曾向他们引用俄国革命小说《钢铁是怎样炼成的》时，这很奇怪。虽然不是教条主义者，习近平非常重视意识形态，甚至将苏联解体部分归咎于莫斯科未能确保人们认真对待马克思列宁主义。 Despite these important differences, Chinese and Russian elites do share a conservative, statist worldview. They both see attacks on their history as Western plots to delegitimize their regimes and consider democracy promotion an existential threat. They both appreciate traditional values as a bulwark against instability and think the West is tearing itself apart with cultural debates. They both have concluded that authoritarian regimes are better at dealing with modern challenges. They both want their countries to regain a lost status and lost territory. Putin and Xi even spin the same legitimation narrative, claiming their predecessors allowed an intolerable (and Western-influenced) degradation of authority that only their strongman rule could arrest. 尽管存在这些重要差异，但中俄精英确实分享了一种保守的、国家主义的世界观。他们都认为对其历史的攻击是西方的阴谋，旨在使其政权失去合法性，并认为民主推广是对其生存的威胁。他们都欣赏传统价值观，认为这是对抗不稳定的堡垒，认为西方正在因文化辩论而自我撕裂。他们都认为威权政权更善于应对现代挑战。他们都希望自己的国家重新获得失去的地位和领土。普京和习近平甚至用相同的合法化叙述，声称他们的前任允许权威的不可容忍的（和西方影响的）退化，只有他们的强人统治才能阻止这种退化。 MAN TO MAN 人对人Another factor binding Moscow and Beijing today are the warm relations between Putin and Xi. Chinese and Russian media tout a strong personal relationship between the two leaders, although it is hard to say how genuine the supposed friendship is. Putin was trained as a KGB agent, an experience that taught him how to manage people, and Xi would have learned similar tricks from his father, a master of the party’s “united front” efforts to win over skeptics. Putin and Xi are very different people. Putin once broke his arm fighting toughs on the Leningrad subway. Xi has consistently demonstrated extraordinary self-control, as evidenced by his ability to rise to power without anyone knowing what he really thought. Putin enjoys high living, while Xi’s personal style seems to border on ascetic. But at the very least, a functional relationship between Russian and Chinese leaders is something of a historical anomaly. 今天，普京和习近平之间的温暖关系是将莫斯科和北京联系在一起的另一个因素。中俄媒体都宣称两位领导人之间有着牢固的个人关系，尽管这种所谓的友谊有多真诚还很难说。普京曾接受过作为克格勃特工的训练，这段经历教会了他如何管理人际关系，而习近平则可能从他的父亲那里学到类似的技巧，习仲勋是党内“统一战线”努力争取怀疑者的高手。普京和习近平是非常不同的人。普京曾在列宁格勒地铁上与恶棍打斗时折断了手臂，而习近平则始终表现出非凡的自我控制力，这从他在上台前没有人知道他真正想法的能力中可见一斑。普京喜欢奢华的生活，而习近平的个人风格似乎接近于苦行僧。但至少，中俄领导人之间的功能性关系在历史上是一种异常现象。 For Mao, Stalin’s ideological credentials and contributions to Soviet history made him a titan of the communist world. Yet Stalin’s cautious attitude toward the Chinese Revolution in the second half of the 1940s rankled him. So did Stalin’s high-handedness during the negotiations for the alliance treaty between the two countries in 1949 and 1950. After Stalin’s death, Mao felt his own stature far outweighed Khrushchev’s, and the chairman famously treated his Soviet counterpart with disdain. 对毛泽东来说，斯大林的意识形态资历和对苏联历史的贡献使他成为共产主义世界的巨人。然而，斯大林在1940年代后半期对中国革命的谨慎态度让毛泽东感到恼火。斯大林在两国之间联盟条约谈判中的高压态度也让他不满。斯大林死后，毛觉得自己的地位远远超过了赫鲁晓夫，毛以蔑视的态度对待他的苏联对手。 Mao was impressed by the toughness his protégé Deng Xiaoping displayed during interminable debates over ideology in Moscow in the 1960s, when Deng was Beijing’s most prominent attack dog on the world stage. After Mao’s death, Deng noted that countries close to the Soviet Union had dysfunctional economies, while U.S. allies thrived. By the time Deng became China’s paramount leader, many of his associates hoped for a better relationship with Moscow, but Deng ignored those voices. He and Gorbachev met only once—during the Tiananmen Square protests—and Deng concluded that the Soviet leader was “an idiot.” After the Soviet Union collapsed and Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia, the Chinese were at first skeptical of him, given his role in helping bring about the demise of communism, but relations among top leaders gradually improved. Deng’s successor, Jiang Zemin, had studied in the Soviet Union and could sing old Sino-Soviet friendship songs. 毛对他的门徒邓小平在1960年代莫斯科漫长的意识形态辩论中表现出的强硬态度印象深刻，当时邓是北京在世界舞台上最突出的攻击者。毛死后，邓指出，靠近苏联的国家经济失调，而美国的盟友则繁荣。到邓成为中国最高领导人时，他的许多同事希望与莫斯科建立更好的关系，但邓无视这些声音。他和戈尔巴乔夫只会面过一次——在天安门广场抗议期间——邓认为这位苏联领导人是“白痴”。苏联解体后，鲍里斯·叶利钦成为俄罗斯总统，中国人起初对他持怀疑态度，因为他在促成共产主义垮台中扮演了重要角色，但顶级领导人之间的关系逐渐改善。邓的继任者江泽民曾在苏联学习，能够唱老的中苏友谊歌曲。 Warm interpersonal relations are not the main reason Russia and China are so close today, but the past certainly shows how much individual leaders can matter when they have disdain for their counterparts and the countries they lead. And despite their differences, it is not hard to guess why Putin and Xi might get along on a personal level. They are almost the same age, and they are both sons of men who sacrificed for their countries. And perhaps most important, they both had formative experiences about the dangers of political instability. During the Cultural Revolution, Xi and his family were kidnapped and beaten by Mao’s Red Guards, and in 1989, Putin, then a KGB officer stationed in Dresden, watched as East Germany collapsed around him while he could not get guidance from Moscow. The two have much to talk about when they make blini and dumplings together for the television cameras. 温暖的个人关系并不是今天中俄关系如此紧密的主要原因，但过去确实表明，当领导人蔑视他们的对手及其领导的国家时，会产生多么大的影响。尽管存在差异，但不难猜测为什么普京和习近平可能在个人层面上相处得很好。他们几乎是同龄人，都是为国家牺牲的父亲的儿子。也许最重要的是，他们都在政治不稳定的危险中形成了重要的经验。文革期间，习近平和他的家人被毛的红卫兵绑架和殴打；1989年，普京作为驻德累斯顿的克格勃军官，目睹了东德的崩溃，而无法从莫斯科获得指导。他们在一起为电视摄像头做煎饼和饺子时，有很多话题可聊。 TEAMING UP 合作共赢Greater flexibility in the partnership between Beijing and Moscow today also makes it hardier than it was in the past. Since 1949, the central strategic challenge has been how the two powers, which together make up Eurasia’s authoritarian heartland, can cooperate effectively against the threat of the U.S.-led democratic periphery. Despite the extraordinary strength of Washington’s position in their neighborhoods, Beijing and Moscow have struggled to get this coordination right. Time and time again, they have proved unwilling to sacrifice their interests for each other, driven in part by a suspicion that the other is selling them out and seeking improved relations with the West. 今天北京和莫斯科之间更大的灵活性使得这种伙伴关系比过去更持久。自1949年以来，中央战略挑战一直是如何有效合作对抗由美国主导的民主外围所带来的威胁，尽管华盛顿在他们邻国中的地位异常强大，北京和莫斯科在协调这一点上屡屡受挫。他们一次次证明不愿为彼此牺牲自己的利益，部分原因是怀疑对方在出卖自己并寻求与西方改善关系。 Before the Sino-Soviet split, the alliance between Moscow and Beijing created real problems for the United States real benefits for the two powers. A calm border between the two countries allowed them to focus on confronting the West and to share military technology. In 1958, when China attacked Taiwan in an attempt to take control of the island, Khrushchev came to Beijing’s aid by publicly warning that he would intervene to protect China if the United States entered the conflict—even though he resented that Beijing had failed to tell him about its plans ahead of time. 在中苏分裂之前，莫斯科和北京之间的联盟给美国带来了真正的问题，并为这两个大国带来了真正的好处。两国之间平静的边界让他们可以专注于对抗西方，并分享军事技术。1958年，中国试图控制台湾岛时，赫鲁晓夫通过公开警告如果美国介入冲突，他将干预保护中国来援助北京，尽管他对北京没有提前告知计划感到不满。 Xi attending a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Moscow, July 2017 习近平在莫斯科无名烈士墓敬献花圈，2017年7月 Sergei Ilnitsky / Reuters 谢尔盖·伊尔尼茨基 / 路透社 Yet the heartland’s relationship with the periphery has always been a mix of coexistence and competition, and Moscow and Beijing have rarely given equal weight to those dueling objectives. During the 1950s and 1960s, China was essentially shut out of the international system while the Soviet Union was largely a status quo power. Mao’s cavalier language threatening nuclear war, along with his use of force on the Chinese-Indian border and against the offshore islands in the Taiwan Strait, raised fears in the Kremlin that China would drag the Soviet Union into war. Moscow supported the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, declined to help China during various crises, and hoped for détente with the West—moves that led leaders in Beijing to conclude that Moscow cared more about the West than it did about the communist bloc. 然而，心脏地带与外围的关系一直是共存与竞争的混合体，莫斯科和北京很少对这些相互冲突的目标给予同等重视。在1950年代和1960年代，中国实际上被国际体系排斥在外，而苏联基本上是一个现状大国。毛的核战争威胁性语言，以及他在中印边境和台湾海峡对近海岛屿使用武力，令克里姆林宫担心中国会将苏联拖入战争。莫斯科支持《核不扩散条约》，在各种危机期间拒绝帮助中国，并希望与西方缓和——这些举动让北京领导人认为莫斯科更关心西方而非共产主义阵营。 Now, China and Russia have switched positions. Beijing hopes to benefit economically and technologically from continued ties with the United States and Europe, while Moscow sees itself in a purely competitive relationship. The Russians undoubtedly wish that Beijing would provide lethal aid in Ukraine and agree to the Power of Siberia 2, a proposed pipeline that would send natural gas to northeastern China. Unlike during the heyday of the Sino-Soviet alliance, however, Beijing is not technically beholden to sacrifice its economic or reputational interests for Moscow because the two are not formal allies. The Russians have less reason to feel betrayed—and the Chinese have less reason to fear entrapment. 现在，中国和俄罗斯交换了立场。北京希望从与美国和欧洲的持续联系中在经济和技术上受益，而莫斯科则将自己视为纯粹的竞争对手。毫无疑问，俄罗斯希望北京在乌克兰提供致命援助，并同意“西伯利亚力量2号”输送天然气到中国东北的拟议管道。然而，不像中苏联盟鼎盛时期，北京在技术上没有义务为了莫斯科牺牲其经济或声誉利益，因为两国并非正式盟友。俄罗斯人感觉到被背叛的理由更少——而中国人对被套牢的恐惧也更少。 HISTORY LESSONS 历史教训As the son of a man so involved in his country’s relationship with Moscow, Xi Jinping knows his history. The past has shown the dangers of both incautious embrace and full-blown enmity. Now, Xi wants to have his cake and eat it, too—move close enough to Russia to create problems for the West, but not so close that China has to decouple entirely. It is not an easy cake to bake, and it may become harder. Washington is trying to make it as difficult as possible by painting Russia and China with the same brush, portraying China (correctly) as facilitating Russia’s war in Ukraine. The conflict has created real economic and reputational costs for Beijing, even as it shies away from some of Moscow’s requests. 作为一位深谙中苏关系的人的儿子，习近平知道这段历史。过去显示了不谨慎的亲近和完全敌对的危险。现在，习近平希望既要接近俄罗斯以给西方制造问题，但又不至于让中国完全脱钩。这不是一块易做的蛋糕，而且可能变得更难。华盛顿正试图使之尽可能困难，通过把俄罗斯和中国同样描绘，将中国（正确地）描绘成帮助俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争。这场冲突给北京带来了实际的经济和声誉成本，尽管它避开了莫斯科的一些要求。 Problems exist in any relationship, especially between great powers. What is different from the Cold War is that thorny ideological and personal issues no longer make such challenges so hard to manage. Absent high-impact but low-probability events—such as the use of a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the collapse of the Russian state, or a war over Taiwan—China will probably maneuver within the broad parameters it has already set out for the relationship. Sometimes Beijing will suggest a close relationship with Moscow, and sometimes it will imply a more distant one, modulating its message as the situation demands. The United States, for its part, may be able to shape some of China’s calculus and limit what kinds of help Russia receives. For the foreseeable future, however, Xi’s model for Chinese-Russian relations will likely prove sturdier than in the past because, perhaps counterintuitively, it avoids the danger of intimacy. 任何关系中都会存在问题，特别是在大国之间。与冷战不同的是，意识形态和个人问题不再使这些挑战难以管理。除非出现高影响但低概率的事件——如在乌克兰使用核武器、俄罗斯国家的崩溃或台湾战争——中国可能会在已为这种关系设定的广泛参数内运作。有时北京会暗示与莫斯科的密切关系，有时则会暗示更疏远的关系，随着形势需要调整其信息。美国方面，可能能够影响中国的一些考量，限制俄罗斯所能获得的帮助类型。然而在可预见的未来，习近平的中俄关系模式可能比过去更坚固，因为或许出人意料的是，它避免了亲密的危险。","categories":["地缘政治，俄罗斯，转发"]},{"path":"/2024/06/20/Why Crimea Is the Key to Peace in Ukraine/","content":"Why Crimea Is the Key to Peace in Ukraine为什么克里米亚是乌克兰和平的关键Opinion by RORY FINNIN 01/13/2023 04:30 AM EST The Politico Rory Finnin is an associate professor of Ukrainian studies at the University of Cambridge.

Here’s why.和平只有在乌克兰保留克里米亚的情况下才可能实现。原因如下。A group of Crimean Tatars, an indigenous people of Ukraine, repair a roadway during the Crimean war in 1855. | Roger Fenton via the Library of Congress 一群克里米亚鞑靼人，在 1855 年克里米亚战争期间修复一条道路。| 罗杰·芬顿通过国会图书馆 The cost has been unbearable. But the deep sacrifices and hard-won battlefield successes of the people of Ukraine have already dealt an epic moral and strategic blow to the Kremlin. Now a Russian military defeat may be on the horizon, provided the West continues to give Ukraine the support it needs.成本已经难以承受。但乌克兰人民深重的牺牲和来之不易的战场胜利，已经给克里姆林宫带来了史诗般的道德和战略打击。现在，只要西方继续给予乌克兰所需的支持，俄罗斯的军事失败可能就在眼前。 Whenever genuine peace talks begin, there’s little doubt that Crimea will feature high on the agenda. Ukraine’s Black Sea peninsula is the ground zero of Russia’s current war of aggression. Since its seizure by Vladimir Putin’s troops in 2014, Crimea has been flooded with weapons, disinformation and fear. Its residents have been cut off from the rest of Ukraine and the wider world.每当真正的和平谈判开始时，克里米亚无疑将是议程上的重点。乌克兰的黑海半岛是俄罗斯当前侵略战争的零点。自从 2014 年弗拉基米尔·普京的军队占领克里米亚以来，这里被武器、虚假信息和恐惧所淹没。其居民已经与乌克兰其他地区以及更广阔的世界隔绝。 There had been a tendency in the West to look away from this Russian occupation of Crimea and shrug our shoulders. But with Ukrainian forces now staging a dogged counteroffensive and striking military targets inside Crimea, there seems to be precious little indifference today. Some pundits are calling on Kyiv to back down and dangle Crimea as a pawn in a future settlement with Russia. Amateur mediators like Elon Musk casually ponder surrendering the peninsula to Putin and calling it a day.西方曾有一种倾向，对俄罗斯占领克里米亚视而不见，耸耸肩膀。但随着乌克兰军队现在发起顽强的反攻，并在克里米亚境内打击军事目标，今天似乎几乎没有人能够保持漠不关心。一些评论员呼吁基辅放弃抵抗，并将克里米亚作为未来与俄罗斯和解的筹码。业余调解者如埃隆·马斯克随意考虑将半岛交给普京，就此打住。 12-mile-long bridge Russia built to connect Crimea to the Russian mainland was seriously damaged in an attack in October 2022. | AP Photo 2022 年 10 月，俄罗斯建造的连接克里米亚与俄罗斯本土的 12 英里长的大桥在一次袭击中严重受损。| AP 图片 Such overtures are too quick to reward Russian aggression, which has razed entire cities and slaughtered thousands of Ukrainian civilians over the last year alone. And they are too slow to recognize that returning Crimea to Ukrainian control is not only a matter of moral and legal principle that would restore rights and freedoms to millions of people under the Kremlin’s occupation. It is also the only practical way any peace plan could succeed.这些姿态对俄罗斯的侵略行为给予了过快的奖赏，仅在过去一年内，这种侵略就已经夷平了整座城市，屠杀了成千上万的乌克兰平民。同时，它们对于承认将克里米亚归还乌克兰控制的必要性反应过慢，这不仅是恢复数百万人在克里姆林宫占领下的权利和自由的道德和法律原则问题。这也是任何和平计划能够成功的唯一切实可行的方式。 The truth is Crimea has no natural physical connection to Russia. Crimea is an extension of the Ukrainian mainland, and as such, it has been deeply connected to and dependent on Ukraine’s resources and trade for centuries.真相是克里米亚与俄罗斯没有自然的物理联系。克里米亚是乌克兰大陆的延伸，因此，几个世纪以来一直与乌克兰的资源和贸易有着深厚的联系和依赖。 Crimea’s historical experience of Russian and Soviet rule, meanwhile, has been one of persistent ethnic cleansing, violence and trauma. This helps explain why a majority of Crimea’s residents voted for Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It also helps explain why in 2013, prior to Russia’s invasion of the peninsula, a large majority of poll respondents in Crimea expressed the view that Crimea should be a part of Ukraine.克里米亚历史上经历了俄罗斯和苏联的统治，这一过程中持续存在着种族清洗、暴力和创伤。这有助于解释为什么在 1991 年乌克兰从苏联独立时，克里米亚的大多数居民投票支持。这也有助于解释为什么在 2013 年，也就是俄罗斯入侵该半岛之前，克里米亚的大多数民意调查受访者表达了克里米亚应该成为乌克兰一部分的观点。 If the past teaches us anything, it is that Crimea suffers decline when separated from Ukraine, and that Crimea triggers conflict when occupied by Russia. Failing to understand this history is to sleepwalk into a future of more military escalation from the Kremlin.如果过去的历史能教给我们什么，那就是克里米亚从乌克兰分离出去时会衰退，而被俄罗斯占领时会引发冲突。不理解这段历史就是在无意识地走向一个由克里姆林宫更多军事升级的未来。 In the spring of 2014, as Vladimir Putin’s “little green men” were invading Crimea, a Russian meme went viral on social media: KrymNash, or “Crimea Is Ours.” It was a classic imperialist message. Brash, insistent claims to conquered territory are what empires do to mask anxieties about their own political legitimacy. As Edward Said once remarked about empires and their colonies, “If you belong in a place, you do not have to keep saying and showing it.”2014 年春，当弗拉基米尔·普京的“小绿人”入侵克里米亚时，一个俄罗斯的网络迷因在社交媒体上病毒式传播：KrymNash，或者说“克里米亚是我们的”。这是一个典型的帝国主义信息。帝国为了掩盖自身政治合法性的焦虑，总是大胆且坚持地宣称对征服地的所有权。正如爱德华·赛义德曾经关于帝国及其殖民地所说：“如果你属于一个地方，你就没有必要不停地说出来和展示。” Russia is an expansionist land empire, and Crimea is one of its most prized colonies. The strategic port of Sevastopol is home to the Kremlin’s Black Sea fleet, while resort towns like Yalta on the mountainous southern coast offer Russian vacationers a rocky Riviera, an exotic playground of warm water beaches.俄罗斯是一个扩张主义的陆地帝国，克里米亚是其最珍贵的殖民地之一。战略港口塞瓦斯托波尔是克里姆林宫黑海舰队的基地，而像雅尔塔这样的山区南海岸度假城镇为俄罗斯度假者提供了一个多岩石的里维埃拉，一个温暖水域海滩的异国情调游乐场。 But behind Crimea’s postcard image lie much deeper realities of demography, history and geography that Russia has anxiously tried to conceal and erase for a long time. One of them is the Crimea of the Crimean Tatars, who are recognized as an indigenous people of Ukraine.但在克里米亚明信片般的形象背后，隐藏着人口、历史和地理等更深层的现实，俄罗斯长期以来一直焦虑地试图隐藏和抹去这些现实。其中之一就是克里米亚鞑靼人的克里米亚，他们被认定为乌克兰的土著民族。 For centuries Crimea was the dominion of the Crimean Tatar khanate, a Sunni Muslim Turkic-speaking state aligned with the Ottoman Empire. Only after invading Crimea four different times did Catherine II succeed in dismantling the khanate in 1783 and in absorbing its territory into a Russian Empire on the march.几个世纪以来，克里米亚一直是克里米亚鞑靼汗国的领土，这是一个与奥斯曼帝国结盟的逊尼派穆斯林突厥语国家。只有在四次入侵克里米亚之后，凯瑟琳二世才在 1783 年成功地解散了汗国，并将其领土吞并进正在扩张的俄罗斯帝国。 But what Catherine acquired in 1783 was not what Putin grabbed in 2014. The territory of the Crimean Tatar khanate she annexed included both the Crimean peninsula and the adjacent steppeland of today’s southern Ukraine, which stretches along the shores of the Black Sea and Azov Sea. In fact, much of the frontline of today’s war follows the contours of what were once the northern reaches of the Crimean Tatar khanate.但凯瑟琳在 1783 年获得的并不是普京在 2014 年夺取的。她所并吞的克里米亚鞑靼汗国领土包括了克里米亚半岛和今天乌克兰南部与黑海和亚速海相邻的草原地带。实际上，如今战争的前线很大程度上沿着曾经是克里米亚鞑靼汗国北部边界的轮廓。 A painting depicts the arrival of Catherine II in Crimea in 1787.

In the mid-19th century, Crimea became the site of an imperial clash of the titans, with British, Ottoman and European allies facing off against Russia over control of the Black Sea region. The Crimean War was the world’s “first armchair war,” a drama and spectacle that reached audiences around the world in something akin to “real time” by way of new technologies like the telegraph. It ended with Russia’s defeat, but in the Western popular imagination, the war served to mingle Crimea and Russia on our mental maps. The effect has been lasting.凯瑟琳去世数十年后，俄罗斯的扩张停止了。19 世纪中叶，克里米亚成为帝国巨头的冲突地，英国、奥斯曼和欧洲盟友在黑海地区与俄罗斯争夺控制权。克里米亚战争是世界上“第一场扶手椅战争”，一场通过电报等新技术在类似“实时”中向全球观众传达的戏剧和壮观。战争以俄罗斯的失败告终，但在西方流行想象中，这场战争使克里米亚和俄罗斯在我们的心理地图上交织在一起。这种影响是持久的。 Despite defeat, the tsars held on to Crimea. But they never let go of anxieties about their control of the territory of the former Crimean Tatar khanate. In 1857, Tsar Aleksandr II took drastic measures to tighten his grip and explicitly ordered “the cleansing of the Tatars from the entire Crimean peninsula” and their replacement by Slavic “peasants from internal provinces” of the empire. At this time Crimean Tatars constituted nearly 80 percent of Crimea’s inhabitants. By 1900 they plummeted to roughly 25 percent of the population.尽管遭到失败，沙皇们仍然紧抓克里米亚不放。但他们从未放松对前克里米亚鞑靼汗国领土控制的焦虑。1857 年，沙皇亚历山大二世采取了严厉措施来加强他的控制，并明确下令“将鞑靼人从整个克里米亚半岛清除”，并由帝国“内部省份的斯拉夫农民”取而代之。当时，克里米亚鞑靼人几乎占了克里米亚居民的 80%。到了 1900 年，他们的人口比例骤降至大约 25%。 In the 20th century, Stalin sought to finish what Aleksandr II started. In May 1944, after the Nazis had retreated, Stalin deported the remaining Crimean Tatar population — approximately 200,000 people — to Central Asia and other far-flung parts of the Soviet Union. The sick and injured not fit for transit on train cars originally meant for livestock were “liquidated.” Those who openly defied the deportation order were shot. Stalin’s Crimean atrocity ultimately claimed tens of thousands of lives. Survivors spent the next half century in places like Uzbekistan fighting for the right to return to their homeland, which they won in the twilight of the Soviet period.在 20 世纪，斯大林试图完成亚历山大二世开始的事业。1944 年 5 月，纳粹撤退后，斯大林将剩余的克里米亚鞑靼人口——大约 20 万人——驱逐到中亚和苏联的其他遥远地区。不适合在原本用于运送牲畜的火车车厢中转运的病弱者被“清除”。那些公然抗命不遵从驱逐令的人被枪杀。斯大林的克里米亚暴行最终夺去了数以万计的生命。幸存者在接下来的半个世纪里，在乌兹别克斯坦等地为重返故土的权利而斗争，他们在苏联时期的末期赢得了这一权利。 Stalin turned what had been a rudimentary system of ethnic cleansing under the tsars into a brutally efficient machine aimed at decimating the past as well as the present. Our maps today bear evidence of this destruction. Before 1944 there were around 2,000 towns and villages in Crimea bearing Crimean Tatar names. After the deportation, only a relative handful remained. Stalin consigned traces of the legacy of the Crimean Tatars to what Orwell would call a “memory hole.”斯大林将沙皇时期原始的种族清洗系统转变为旨在摧毁过去和现在的残酷高效机器。我们今天的地图上留下了这种破坏的证据。1944 年之前，克里米亚有大约 2000 个带有克里米亚鞑靼名字的城镇和村庄。在遣送之后，只有少数幸存下来。斯大林将克里米亚鞑靼的遗产痕迹置于奥威尔所说的“记忆黑洞”。 The Crimean village of Üsküt, today known as Pryvitne, lies empty in 1945 after Soviet dictator Josef Stalin deported the Crimean Tatars to Central Asia. | Wikimedia Commons 1945 年，苏联独裁者约瑟夫·斯大林将克里米亚鞑靼人驱逐到中亚后，今天被称为普里维特内的克里米亚村庄乌斯库特空无一人。| 维基共享资源 These changes took place with great speed. After demoting Crimea from the status of an Autonomous Republic to a mere oblast or “province” of Soviet Russia, Communist Party authorities ordered that Crimean Tatar names of cities, towns and villages be replaced with Russian ones. The daunting task fell to one man, the executive secretary of the newspaper Red Crimea, who had to rename a territory roughly the size of Massachusetts virtually overnight. For ideas, he flipped through a 19th-century fruiticulture book, on the one hand, and an account of the Red Army’s Crimean offensive against the Nazi Wehrmacht on the other.这些变化发生得非常快。在将克里米亚的地位从自治共和国降为苏维埃俄国的一个普通州或“省”之后，共产党当局下令将克里米亚鞑靼人的城市、镇和村庄名称更换为俄罗斯名称。这项艰巨的任务落在了一名男子身上，他是报纸《红色克里米亚》的执行秘书，不得不在一个晚上的时间内重新命名一个与马萨诸塞州差不多大小的地区。为了寻找灵感，他一方面翻阅了一本 19 世纪的果树栽培书，另一方面则查看了红军对纳粹德国国防军在克里米亚的进攻记录。 That is why the names of so many places in Crimea strike visitors as bland and unimaginative today. Kiçkene, a village near Simferopol with only 156 recorded residents in 1939, became Malenkoe, “Smallville.” Qutlaq, a village in the Sudak region first cited in historical records in the 15th century, had a majority population of 1,636 Crimean Tatars in 1939. For assisting the Soviet partisan movement during the war, its residents had to watch as Nazi occupiers retaliated by burning the village to the ground. Qutlaq was renamed Veseloe, “Happytown.”这就是为什么如今克里米亚许多地方的名字给游客的印象是平淡无奇和缺乏想象力。位于辛菲罗波尔附近的小村庄 Kiçkene，在 1939 年仅有 156 名居民记录，后来被改名为 Malenkoe，“小镇”。Qutlaq 是苏达克地区的一个村庄，最早在 15 世纪的历史记录中被提到，1939 年时有 1,636 名克里米亚鞑靼人占多数。在战争期间，由于协助苏联游击队，村民们不得不眼睁睁看着纳粹占领者报复性地将村庄烧毁。Qutlaq 后来被改名为 Veseloe，“快乐镇”。 This campaign to efface the Crimean Tatar people from Crimea — both physically and symbolically — intersected with a campaign to replace them. Between 1944 and 1946 alone, the Kremlin distributed stolen Crimean Tatar homes and property to roughly 64,000 settlers who arrived from other Soviet oblasts. Tens of thousands more arrived in the 1950s. Stalinist officials explicitly described this project in revealing terms. It was an initiative “to make Crimea a new Crimea with its own Russian form.”这场旨在从克里米亚抹去克里米亚鞑靼人的存在——无论是物理上还是象征上的——的运动与一场取而代之的运动交织在一起。仅在 1944 年至 1946 年间，克里姆林宫就将被掠夺的克里米亚鞑靼人的房屋和财产分配给了大约 64,000 名从其他苏维埃州迁来的定居者。1950 年代又有成千上万的人抵达。斯大林主义官员明确地用揭示性的术语描述了这个项目。这是一个“使克里米亚成为具有自己的俄罗斯形式的新克里米亚”的倡议。 Such statements from Soviet authorities implicitly acknowledge that, prior to the 1940s, Crimea did not have a “Russian form.” They give the lie to claims that Crimea is “primordial” Russian territory, as Putin likes to insist. In the 1950s, the poet Boris Chichibabin walked through Crimea’s old Tatar streets and put it bluntly: “This is not Russia at all.”苏维埃当局的这些声明暗示承认，在 1940 年代之前，克里米亚并没有“俄罗斯形态”。它们揭穿了克里米亚是“自古以来”的俄罗斯领土的说法，正如普京喜欢坚称的那样。在 1950 年代，诗人鲍里斯·契契巴宾走过克里米亚的老塔塔尔街道，直言不讳地说：“这根本就不是俄罗斯。” Another truth about Crimea that Russians work hard to dismiss and conceal today is the peninsula’s dependence on the Ukrainian mainland.克里米亚半岛依赖乌克兰本土是俄罗斯人今天努力忽视和掩盖的另一个事实。 But Stalin’s successor, Nikita Khrushchev, learned the lesson up close and personal. In 1953 he travelled to Crimea with his son-in-law, the prominent Soviet journalist Aleksei Adzhubei. The trip was no vacation. According to Adzhubei, Khrushchev had a series of awkward encounters with crowds of post-war Soviet settlers, who made desperate pleas for more material assistance. Khrushchev was frustrated by all the complaints. “Why did you come here anyway?” Adzhubei recalls Khrushchev asking the settlers. “We were tricked!” they replied.但斯大林的继任者尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫亲身学到了这个教训。1953 年，他和他的女婿、著名苏联记者阿列克谢·阿兹朱别一起前往克里米亚。这趟旅行并非度假。据阿兹朱别回忆，赫鲁晓夫在与一群战后苏联移民的尴尬接触中，不断听到他们对更多物质援助的迫切请求。赫鲁晓夫对所有这些抱怨感到沮丧。“你们为什么要来这里？”阿兹朱别记得赫鲁晓夫问移民们。“我们被骗了！”他们回答说。 Adzhubei described Crimea at the time as a deeply “desolate” region still struggling to rebound from Nazi occupation and what he called Stalin’s “Tatar genocide,” which had not only depopulated the peninsula but deprived it of agricultural know-how in the cultivation of vineyards and tobacco fields.阿朱别当时描述克里米亚为一个深度“荒凉”的地区，仍在努力从纳粹占领中恢复过来，以及他所说的斯大林的“鞑靼种族灭绝”，这不仅使半岛人口锐减，还剥夺了它在葡萄园和烟草田种植方面的农业知识。 Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, shown above in 1959.

According to Dmitrii Polianskii, who served as head of the Communist Party in Crimea between 1953 and 1954, Khrushchev came to the conclusion that “Russia had paid little attention to Crimea’s development” and that “Ukraine could handle it more concertedly.”根据所有的描述，克里米亚的凄凉状况震惊了赫鲁晓夫。据曾在 1953 年至 1954 年间担任克里米亚共产党负责人的德米特里·波利扬斯基所说，赫鲁晓夫得出结论：“俄罗斯对克里米亚的发展关注甚少”，并且“乌克兰可以更有条不紊地处理这一问题。” Khrushchev and other Soviet authorities learned the hard way that Crimea is not an “island” or a “jewel,” as Russian metaphors would have it, a beautiful but self-sufficient swath of territory. Instead, to reach for another metaphor, Crimea is a flower whose blossom floats in the Black Sea and whose stem reaches deep into the Ukrainian steppe, into the territory around today’s frontline cities of Kherson, Melitopol’, and Mariupol’.赫鲁晓夫和其他苏联当局通过艰难的方式了解到，克里米亚不是俄罗斯比喻中的“岛屿”或“珠宝”，一个美丽但自给自足的地域。相反，用另一个比喻来说，克里米亚是一朵花，它的花朵在黑海上漂浮，它的茎深深扎入乌克兰大草原，延伸到如今前线城市赫尔松、梅利托波尔和马里乌波尔周围的领土。 The Crimean Tatars used to refer to this steppeland as the Özü qırları or Özü çölleri, the “Dnipro fields.” The reference to the Dnipro (or Dnieper), Ukraine’s largest river, was not ornamental. The Crimean peninsula is largely arid and warm, lacking abundant fresh water of its own. For centuries it has thirsted for the Dnipro’s water and relied on resource flows from mainland Ukraine.克里米亚鞑靼人曾将这片草原称为Özü qırları或Özü çölleri，即“第聂伯河田野”。提到第聂伯河（或称为尼珀尔河），乌克兰最长的河流，并非仅仅是装饰性的。克里米亚半岛大部分地区干旱炎热，缺乏充足的自有淡水资源。几个世纪以来，它一直渴望第聂伯河的水，并依赖来自乌克兰本土的资源流。 In February 1954, Khrushchev’s regime took action to rejoin the blossom to its stem, announcing the formal transfer of the Crimean oblast from Soviet Russia to Soviet Ukraine. During the formal Politburo proceedings, Soviet Russian politician Mikhail Tarasov justified the transfer by describing Crimea in the way we should understand it today: as “a natural continuation of Ukraine’s southern steppe.”1954 年 2 月，赫鲁晓夫政权采取行动将花朵重新接回其茎干，宣布正式将克里米亚州从苏联俄罗斯转移到苏联乌克兰。在正式的政治局会议上，苏联俄罗斯政治家米哈伊尔·塔拉索夫为转移行为辩护，他描述克里米亚应该被我们今天理解的方式：作为“乌克兰南部草原的自然延续”。 Adzhubei called the transfer a “business transaction” directed toward Crimea’s economic development. It produced quick dividends. In 1957, Ukrainian authorities in Kyiv oversaw the launch of what had been decades earlier merely a Russian pipedream: the construction of the North Crimean Canal, which expedited flows from the Dnipro river near Kherson to irrigate the entire peninsula. Crimea’s economy, particularly its agricultural sector, improved dramatically. So did its tourism industry. High-rise sanatoria for the Soviet elite popped up along the southern coast, driving the image of a Soviet Shangri-La along the Black Sea.阿朱别称这次转移是一次“商业交易”，旨在促进克里米亚的经济发展。这笔交易很快产生了回报。1957 年，乌克兰当局在基辅监督启动了几十年前仅仅是俄罗斯的一个梦想：北克里米亚运河的建设，该运河从靠近赫尔松的第聂伯河加快了水流，灌溉了整个半岛。克里米亚的经济，特别是其农业部门，得到了显著改善。其旅游业也是如此。苏联精英的高层疗养院沿着南部海岸线涌现，打造了一幅黑海沿岸的苏维埃香格里拉的形象。 A Soviet stamp from 1951 celebrating plans for the North Crimean Canal joining the Crimean peninsula and mainland Ukraine. | The Post of the Soviet Union via Wikimedia Commons 1951 年苏联邮票，庆祝北克里米亚运河计划，连接克里米亚半岛和乌克兰本土。| 苏联邮政通过维基共享资源 Only in later years would Ukraine’s success in developing Crimea be denigrated and mythologized as Khrushchev’s “gift” of Crimea to Ukraine – or worse, as Khrushchev’s “mistake.” The transfer of Crimea to Ukraine was no mistake. It was a rescue.仅在后来的岁月里，乌克兰在发展克里米亚的成功才被贬低，并被神话化为赫鲁晓夫将克里米亚“赠送”给乌克兰的“礼物”——或者更糟，被视为赫鲁晓夫的“错误”。克里米亚转交给乌克兰并非错误。这是一次营救。 Connecting the dots between Crimea’s geography, history and scarred demography helps explain some of the trajectories of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. It also illustrates the need for Ukraine’s absolute victory.连接克里米亚的地理、历史和饱受创伤的人口统计之间的点，有助于解释俄罗斯对乌克兰侵略行径的一些轨迹。这也说明了乌克兰绝对胜利的必要性。 Putin’s 2014 annexation operation ended up disconnecting Crimea from resource flows from Ukraine, including the North Crimean Canal, which still supplied 85 percent of fresh water to the peninsula. His massive vanity bridge, stretching 12 miles over the Kerch Strait from the eastern edge of Crimea to mainland Russia, was completed in 2018 but could not come close to compensating for these losses. That’s why in February 2022 — on the very first day of the full-scale invasion — Putin’s forces used Crimea as a launchpad to tear into Ukraine’s Kherson oblast and seize control of this critical water and resource supply. The move was an implicit recognition of a fundamental reality: Crimea needs to be connected to the Ukrainian mainland to thrive or even survive.普京 2014 年的吞并行动最终导致克里米亚与乌克兰的资源流动断开，包括北克里米亚运河，该运河仍然为半岛提供了 85%的淡水。他那座横跨刻赤海峡、从克里米亚东缘延伸至俄罗斯大陆的长达 12 英里的巨型虚荣桥在 2018 年完工，但这座桥远远无法弥补这些损失。这就是为什么在 2022 年 2 月——全面入侵的第一天——普京的军队使用克里米亚作为跳板，撕裂乌克兰的赫尔松州并控制这一关键的水资源供应。此举是对一个基本现实的含蓄承认：克里米亚需要与乌克兰大陆相连，才能繁荣甚至生存。 Russia’s hold on Crimea is, therefore tenuous. Any proposed peace settlement that codifies its occupation in exchange for a cessation of hostilities would be a ticking time bomb. The truth is that Ukraine will never be stable and peaceful with a Russian-occupied Crimea, and a Russian-occupied Crimea will never be resource-secure without Ukraine.因此，俄罗斯对克里米亚的控制是脆弱的。任何旨在通过确认其占领地位以换取停止敌对行动的和平解决方案都将是一个定时炸弹。事实是，只要克里米亚被俄罗斯占领，乌克兰就永远不会稳定与和平，而一个被俄罗斯占领的克里米亚也永远不会在没有乌克兰的情况下实现资源安全。 A boy holds an icon during a procession celebrating Orthodox Christmas in occupied Sevastopol, Crimea, Jan. 7, 2023. | AP Photo 一个男孩在庆祝东正教圣诞节的游行中举着一个圣像，这场游行在被占领的塞瓦斯托波尔，克里米亚举行，时间是 2023 年 1 月 7 日。 | AP 照片 Crimean Tatar activist and Amnesty International prisoner of conscience Emir-Usein Kuku frames the problem with a sardonic question that refers to the Russian security and intelligence agency, the FSB.克里米亚鞑靼活动家和国际特赦组织良心犯埃米尔-乌谢因·库库用一个讽刺的问题来描述这个问题，这个问题涉及俄罗斯安全和情报机构，即联邦安全局（FSB）。 “Doesn’t it seem strange,” he asked during his illegal trial in Russia in 2019, “that in the 23 years under Ukrainian authority in Crimea there were no ‘extremists,’ no ‘terrorists,’ and no ‘acts of terror’ for that matter? But then Russia arrived with its FSB, and suddenly all of these things appeared together?”“在俄罗斯 2019 年的非法审判中，他问道，‘这难道不奇怪吗？在克里米亚处于乌克兰管辖的 23 年里，没有‘极端分子’，没有‘恐怖分子’，也没有‘恐怖行为’。但是随后俄罗斯带着它的联邦安全局来了，突然所有这些事情一起出现了？’” The track record is clear. Ukraine stabilized Crimea; Russia has turned it into a hinge of expansionist aggression. In 2014 the world stood by and let it happen in the vain hope of easy peace.轨迹清晰可见。乌克兰稳定了克里米亚；俄罗斯却将其变成了扩张侵略的枢纽。2014 年，世界在徒劳希望和平的幻想中袖手旁观，任由这一切发生。 We cannot afford to make the same mistake now. Half-measures and short-sighted compromises are a recipe for endless war against a state bent on savage imperialist conquest. The difficult path to lasting peace is Ukraine’s de-occupation of Crimea and an unmistakable defeat of Russian aggression.我们现在不能再犯同样的错误。折中措施和目光短浅的妥协是对抗一个致力于野蛮帝国主义征服的国家的无休止战争的食谱。通往持久和平的艰难道路是乌克兰对克里米亚的去占领以及对俄罗斯侵略行为的明确失败。 Europe and the United States should know well the urgency of a total defeat of the aggressor. In his address to Congress in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Franklin Delano Roosevelt pledged that, “no matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.”欧洲和美国应该清楚地认识到彻底击败侵略者的紧迫性。1941 年 12 月珍珠港袭击事件发生后，富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福在对国会的演讲中承诺：“无论我们需要多长时间来克服这一预谋的入侵，美国人民凭借他们正义的力量将会取得绝对的胜利。” Now as then, only absolute victory will do. Only a defeated, demilitarized Russia and a fully liberated Ukraine — whole and integral within its internationally recognised borders — can promise long-term stability and an enduring peace.如今如同过去，唯有彻底的胜利才算数。只有一个被击败、去军事化的俄罗斯，以及一个完全解放的、在其国际公认边界内完整无缺的乌克兰，才能保证长期稳定和持久和平。","categories":["地缘政治，乌克兰，转发"]},{"path":"/2024/06/17/sleepwalking toward war/","content":"梦游般走向战争：美国和中国会听从二十世纪灾难的警告吗？ Sleepwalking Toward WarBy Odd Arne Westad July/August 2024 Foreign Affairs 在《盎格鲁-德意志对抗的兴起，1860-1914》中，英国历史学家保罗·肯尼迪解释了两国传统友好的人民如何最终陷入相互敌对的恶性循环，导致了一战。主要的结构性力量驱动了德国和英国之间的竞争：经济需求、地理和意识形态。德国的快速经济崛起打破了权力平衡，使柏林能够扩大其战略影响力。这种扩展——特别是在海上——发生在英国拥有深远战略利益的地区。两国越来越多地将彼此视为意识形态的对立面，极度夸大了他们的差异。德国人将英国人描绘成世界的贪婪剥削者，而英国人则将德国人描绘为扩张和压迫的专制恶棍。 两国似乎在碰撞的轨道上，注定要战争。但并不是结构性的压力（尽管它们很重要）引发了第一次世界大战。战争爆发是由于个人的偶然决策以及双方想象力的严重缺乏。可以肯定，战争总是有可能的。但它只是不可避免的，如果我们持有一种极不历史性的观点，认为德国和英国之间的妥协是不可能的。 如果德国在奥托·冯·俾斯麦首相之后的领导人没有如此公然地改变海军力量平衡，战争可能不会发生。德国庆祝其在欧洲的主导地位，坚持其作为大国的权利，无视国际行为规则和规范的担忧。这种姿态不仅引起了英国的警惕，也让其他国家感到不安。而德国声称要建立一个新的、更公正和包容的世界秩序，同时威胁其邻国并与正在努力否认边境人民民族愿望的腐朽的奥匈帝国结盟，这一立场很难令人信服。 另一方也存在类似的视野狭隘。英国海军首领温斯顿·丘吉尔在1913年得出结论，英国的全球领先地位“在别人看来常常不如我们看来那么合理”。英国人对他人的看法往往缺乏这种自我意识。官员和评论员对德国满口恶毒，特别是抨击德国不公平的贸易做法。伦敦对柏林保持警惕，解读其所有行为为侵略意图的证据，未能理解德国在一个潜在敌人环绕的大陆上对自身安全的担忧。当然，英国的敌意只会加深德国的恐惧并激起德国的野心。“很少有人拥有那种慷慨或洞察力去寻求英德关系的大规模改善，”肯尼迪感叹道。 这种慷慨或洞察力在今天的中美关系中也严重缺乏。就像一战前的德国和英国一样，中国和美国似乎也陷入了一个可能以灾难告终的恶性循环。与一个世纪前的情况类似，深刻的结构性因素加剧了对抗。经济竞争、地缘政治恐惧和深深的不信任增加了冲突的可能性。 但结构不是命运。领导者的决策可以防止战争并更好地管理大国竞争中不可避免的紧张局势。与德国和英国一样，结构性力量可能推动事件走向高潮，但需要巨大的贪婪和无能才会导致灾难。同样，明智的判断和能力可以防止最坏的情况。 战线已经划定与一个多世纪前德国和英国之间的敌意相似，中美之间的对抗有着深刻的结构性根源。这可以追溯到冷战结束。在那场伟大冲突的后期，北京和华盛顿曾是某种程度上的盟友，因为他们都比彼此更惧怕苏联的力量。但苏联解体后，他们的共同敌人几乎立即让政策制定者更多地关注北京和华盛顿之间的分歧而非联合点。美国越来越厌恶中国的压迫性政府。中国对美国的全球霸权干涉感到不满。 但这种看法的加剧并没有导致中美关系的立即恶化。在冷战结束后的十几年里，历届美国政府认为通过促进中国的现代化和经济增长可以获得很多利益。就像英国最初接受德国在1870年的统一和之后的经济扩张一样，美国人出于自身利益动机，助长了北京的崛起。中国是美国商品和资本的巨大市场，而且它似乎决心按美国的方式做生意，像接受美国的消费习惯和市场运作理念一样，接受美国的风格和品牌。 德国和英国在碰撞轨道上——但第一次世界大战并非不可避免。 在地缘政治层面，中国对美国的看法在2003年入侵和占领伊拉克时开始变得更加阴暗。尽管北京对伊拉克总统萨达姆·侯赛因政权不感兴趣，中国反对美国主导的攻击。比起美国强大的军事能力，更让北京震惊的是美国轻易地无视主权和不干涉原则，而这些是美国引导中国加入的国际秩序的支柱。中国政策制定者担心，如果美国能如此轻易地违背它期望他人遵守的规范，其未来的行为将难以约束。从2000年到2005年，中国的军事预算翻了一番，然后在2009年又翻了一番。北京还启动了改进其军事训练、提高效率和投资新技术的项目。它革命性地改进了其海军和导弹部队。在2015年至2020年之间，中国海军舰艇的数量超过了美国海军。 一些人认为，不管美国在二十年前做什么，中国都会大幅扩展其军事能力。毕竟，随着经济实力的增长，这是主要崛起大国的常规做法。也许是这样，但北京扩张的具体时间显然与它担心全球霸主有意愿和能力遏制中国的崛起有关。正如一位中国军事策划者在美国入侵后的总结中有些夸张地说的那样，伊拉克的昨天可能就是中国的明天。正如德国在1890年代和1900年代初期担心在其经济增长最快的时候会在经济和战略上被遏制，中国也开始担心在其经济腾飞时会被美国遏制。 在衰败之前如果说有一个例子可以说明傲慢和恐惧在同一领导层内共存，那就是威廉二世统治下的德国。德国认为它不可阻挡地在崛起，而英国代表了其崛起的生存威胁。德国报纸充满了对该国经济、技术和军事进步的预测，预言德国将超越所有其他国家的未来。根据许多德国人（以及一些非德国人）的说法，他们的政府模式，以其高效的民主和专制的混合，是世界的羡慕对象。他们声称，英国实际上不是一个欧洲大国，坚称德国现在是欧洲大陆上最强大的力量，它应该被自由地根据其实力的现实重新排列区域。而事实上，如果没有英国的干涉以及英国可能与法国和俄罗斯联手遏制德国的成功，它将能够做到这一点。 从1890年代起，两国的民族主义情绪高涨，对对方的恶意看法也愈加阴暗。柏林越来越担心其邻国和英国在破坏德国在其大陆上的自然发展，阻止其未来的主导地位。德国领导人几乎没有意识到他们自己的侵略性言论如何影响他人，开始将英国的干涉视为他们国内外问题的根本原因。他们将英国的重新武装和更严格的贸易政策视为侵略意图的迹象。“所以著名的德国包围终于成了现实，”威廉在1914年战争酝酿时叹息道。“网突然在我们头上收紧，英国在全世界轻蔑地追求的纯粹反德政策赢得了最壮观的胜利。”在他们看来，英国领导人认为德国是大英帝国相对衰退的主要原因，尽管许多其他大国也在以英国为代价崛起。 今天的中国表现出许多与19世纪90年代后德国相似的傲慢和恐惧迹象。中共领导人在2008年全球金融危机及其后果中，比西方同行更为敏锐地引导了国家，这让他们感到无比自豪。许多中国官员将那个时代的全球衰退不仅视为美国制造的灾难，还视为世界经济从美国向中国领导过渡的象征。中国领导人，包括商业界领导人，花了大量时间向他人解释，中国不可阻挡的崛起已成为国际事务的决定性趋势。在其区域政策中，中国对其邻国的行为更加自信。它还压制了西藏和新疆的自决运动，削弱了香港的自治。近年来，它更频繁地坚持有权接管台湾，必要时将使用武力，并开始加强对这种征服的准备。 总之，越来越多的中国傲慢和美国日益高涨的民族主义帮助2016年将唐纳德·特朗普送上了总统宝座，因为他通过将中国描绘成国际舞台上的恶意力量来吸引选民。在任期间，特朗普开始针对中国进行军事扩张并发动贸易战，以巩固美国的商业霸主地位，这标志着与其前任奥巴马所采取的较为温和的政策的明显分裂。2021年，乔·拜登取代特朗普后，他保留了许多特朗普针对中国的政策——受到两党共识的支持，即认为中国是对美国利益的重大威胁——并且自那以来实施了更多贸易限制，以使中国企业更难获取尖端技术。 2018年11月，法国马西热斯的一战战壕 Christian Hartmann / Reuters 北京对华盛顿这一强硬转变的反应是，在与他人打交道时表现出雄心勃勃和不安全感。它对美国行为的一些抱怨与德国在20世纪初对英国提出的抱怨惊人地相似。北京指责华盛顿试图维持一种本质上不公正的世界秩序——这与柏林对伦敦的指责相同。“美国不断宣称要维护的是一个为美国自身利益服务并延续其霸权的所谓国际秩序，”中国外交部在2022年6月发布的白皮书中宣称。“美国本身是对现行世界秩序最大的不稳定因素。” 与此同时，美国一直在努力制定一种对华政策，将威慑与有限合作相结合，类似于英国在20世纪初制定对德政策时所做的那样。根据拜登政府2022年10月的《国家安全战略》，”中华人民共和国怀有重塑国际秩序的意图，并且越来越有能力将全球竞技场向其有利方向倾斜。”尽管反对这种重塑，政府强调，它“始终愿意在我们的利益一致的地方与中国合作。”为了强化这一点，政府声明，“我们不能让分歧阻止我们在必须共同努力的优先事项上取得进展。”现在的问题是——就像1914年之前的那些年一样——即使在关键问题上的合作机会，也会在相互指责、琐碎的恼怒和日益加深的战略不信任中迷失。 在英德关系中，导致从不断加剧的对抗走向战争的三个主要条件是。首先，德国人越来越相信，在任何情况下，英国都不会允许德国崛起。同时，德国领导人似乎无法向英国或其他任何人具体说明他们国家的崛起将如何或不会重塑世界。第二，双方都担心未来地位的削弱。这种观点具有讽刺意味的是，它鼓励一些领导人认为他们应该早点打仗而不是晚点。第三，几乎完全缺乏战略沟通。1905年，德国参谋总长阿尔弗雷德·冯·施里芬提出了一项作战计划，旨在确保在欧洲大陆的迅速胜利，在那里德国必须考虑到法国和俄罗斯。至关重要的是，该计划涉及入侵比利时，这一行为使英国有了立即参战反对德国的理由。正如肯尼迪所言，“两国之间的对抗早在施里芬计划成为唯一的德国军事战略之前就已出现；但需要普鲁士参谋总长的卓越才华，才能提供将这种对抗转化为战争的契机。” 所有这些条件现在似乎都存在于中美关系中。中国国家主席习近平和中共领导层确信美国的主要目标是无论如何阻止中国的崛起。中国关于其国际抱负的声明如此平淡，以至于几乎没有意义。在内部，中国领导人对国家经济放缓和人民忠诚度严重关切。与此同时，美国的政治分裂如此严重，以至于有效的长期治理变得几乎不可能。由于双方互动有限，中美之间的战略误传潜力巨大。所有现有证据都表明，中国正在制定军事计划，某一天入侵台湾，就像施里芬计划帮助引发德英战争一样。 新剧本与见证了最终灾难的20世纪初期的惊人相似，预示着对抗升级的黯淡未来。但冲突可以避免。如果美国想要防止战争，它必须说服中国领导人，美国并不是铁了心要阻止中国未来的经济发展。中国是一个庞大的国家。它有与美国相当的工业。但像1900年的德国一样，它也有一些贫穷和欠发达的地区。美国不能通过其言辞或行动，向中国重复德国一个世纪前从英国听到的理解：如果你停止增长，就不会有问题。 同时，中国的工业不能以牺牲所有其他国家为代价不受限制地继续增长。中国在贸易上最聪明的做法是同意规范其出口，使其他国家的国内工业在电动车或太阳能电池板和其他去碳化必要设备等重要领域的竞争不至于无法进行。如果中国继续向其他市场倾销这些产品的廉价版本，许多国家，包括一些对中国增长并不过分担忧的国家，将开始单方面限制中国商品的市场准入。 北京指责华盛顿维持本质上不公正的世界秩序。 无限制的贸易战对任何人都没有好处。各国越来越多地对进口商品征收更高的关税，限制贸易和资本流动。但如果这种趋势变成关税的洪流，那么世界将在经济和政治上陷入困境。具有讽刺意味的是，如果保护主义政策在各地盛行，中国和美国可能都是净输家。正如德国贸易协会在1903年警告的那样，保护主义政策的国内收益“与这种关税战争对两国经济利益造成的无法估量的损害相比微不足道。”贸易战也在很大程度上促成了1914年真正的战争爆发。 遏制贸易战是一个开始，但北京和华盛顿也应该努力结束或至少遏制可能引发更大冲突的热战。在激烈的大国竞争中，即使是小规模的冲突也可能带来灾难性的后果，正如一战前的情况所表明的那样。以俄罗斯当前对乌克兰的侵略战争为例。去年的进攻和反击没有大幅改变前线；西方国家希望在乌克兰勇敢和西方武器的帮助下，争取到最好的条件停火。目前，乌克兰的胜利将包括击退2022年全面的俄罗斯进攻，以及在确保西方安全保障的条款下，快速推进该国加入欧盟，防止俄罗斯违反停火协议。许多西方阵营的人希望中国在这样的谈判中发挥建设性作用，因为北京强调“尊重所有国家的主权和领土完整。”中国应该记住，德国在第一次世界大战前犯的一个重大错误是，尽管德国领导人呼吁国际正义的崇高原则，但却在奥匈帝国在巴尔干地区骚扰其邻国时袖手旁观。这种虚伪帮助引发了1914年的战争。目前，中国在对待俄罗斯的问题上重复了这个错误。 尽管乌克兰战争目前引发了最多的紧张局势，但台湾可能成为2020年代的巴尔干。中国和美国似乎都在梦游般地走向某个时候的跨海峡对抗。越来越多的中国外交政策专家现在认为台湾战争的可能性大于不可能，而美国政策制定者则专注于如何最好地支持这个岛屿。关于台湾局势，显而易见的是，所有相关方都明白——除了那些最专注于实现正式独立的台湾人——唯一可能有助于避免灾难的妥协是什么。在1972年的《上海公报》中，美国承认只有一个中国，台湾是中国的一部分。北京一再声明希望最终与台湾和平统一。今天重申这些原则将有助于防止冲突：华盛顿可以声明在任何情况下都不会支持台湾独立，北京可以宣布除非台湾正式采取步骤走向独立，否则不会使用武力。这样的妥协不会使与台湾有关的所有问题消失。但它将大大减少因台湾而引发大国战争的可能性。 2024年5月，北京的一名中国士兵 Tingshu Wang / Reuters 遏制经济对抗和减缓潜在地区热点对避免重演英德情景至关重要，但中美之间的敌意上升也使许多其他问题变得紧迫。迫切需要军控倡议和解决其他冲突的努力，例如以色列和巴勒斯坦之间的冲突。需要显示相互尊重的迹象。1972年，当苏联和美国领导人同意一套《美利坚合众国与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟关系的基本原则》时，这项联合声明几乎没有实现任何具体目标。但它在双方之间建立了一定程度的信任，并帮助说服苏联领导人勃列日涅夫美国并非一心要对付他。如果习近平像勃列日涅夫一样，打算终身任职，这是一项值得投资的事情。 大国紧张局势的上升也需要保持可信的威慑力。关于联盟体系导致1914年战争的说法一直是一个持久的神话，认为一系列相互防御条约使各国政府卷入了不可控制的冲突。事实上，在1914年7月欧洲列强开始互相动员后，几乎肯定会爆发战争的原因是德国错误地希望英国最终不会援助其朋友和盟友。对于美国来说，未来十年内，不能提供任何导致这种错误的原因。它应该将其军事力量集中在印太地区，使这支力量成为对中国侵略的有效威慑。它还应该重振北约，让欧洲在自身防御中承担更大份额的责任。 领导人可以从过去中学到正反两方面的教训，关于该做什么和不该做什么。但他们必须首先学习大教训，最重要的是如何避免将几代人的成就化为乌有的可怕战争。","categories":["阅读，地缘政治，转发"]},{"path":"/2024/06/06/MacOS OpenWrt/","content":"MacOS黑苹果折腾OpenWrt

首先可以查看系统空间使用情况，1234567root@OpenWrt:~# df -hFilesystem Size Used Available Use% Mounted on/dev/root 102.3M 17.9M 82.3M 18% /romtmpfs 491.4M 68.0K 491.3M 0% /tmp/dev/vda1 16.0M 6.1M 9.8M 38% /boot/dev/vda1 16.0M 6.1M 9.8M 38% /boottmpfs 512.0K 0 512.0K 0% /dev 其中 /dev/root 是系统固件目录，不用考虑。/dev/vda* 就是系统实际可用的硬盘空间。记着上面明明分配了 10GB 空间给 openwrt 但是由于系统分区是在下载的固件中定义好的，所以其余空间就没有被识别。由于默认存储空间过小，当安装了过多的插件后，会提示空间不足导致无法安装更多插件： 12verify_pkg_installable: Only have 0kb available on filesystem /overlay, pkg luci-app-openvpn needs 9opkg_install_cmd:

Zamir, our driver, was leaning against the window smoking a cigarette. Tim [Hill] sat on the&nbsp;front seat loading a roll of film into a camera. The dull hue of daybreak hung in the sky. I&nbsp;knocked on the cold glass, opened the door and considered our surroundings. As far as I could see, snow-covered peaks zig-zagged their way across the horizon. The sun rose quickly; “It’s going to be hot,” said Zamir.&nbsp;我醒来的时候，天亮大概还有半个小时。我们的司机扎米尔靠在窗户上抽着烟。蒂姆[希尔]坐在前座上给相机装着胶卷。天空中挂着黎明的暗淡色调。我敲了敲冰冷的玻璃，打开门，打量了一下周围的环境。我能看到的尽头，被雪覆盖的山峰在地平线上锯齿状延伸。太阳迅速升起；“今天会很热，”扎米尔说。 Kyrgyzstan sits in the heart of central Asia. It is one of&nbsp;the least-talked-about countries in the world but what&nbsp;it&nbsp;lacks in notoriety, it makes up for in geography: a quasi-crossroads between Russia, China, Europe and Afghanistan, which since the days of Marco Polo has had&nbsp;vital geopolitical significance. To follow in his footsteps is a wonderful thing; in a country where transportation has been the lifeblood of the economy for&nbsp;more than 2,000 years, it seems fitting to load the car up and get out onto the road. &nbsp;吉尔吉斯斯坦位于中亚腹地。它是世界上最少被提及的国家之一，但它在知名度上的不足，却在地理位置上得到了弥补：它几乎是俄罗斯、中国、欧洲和阿富汗之间的交叉路口，自马可·波罗时代以来就具有重要的地缘政治意义。追随他的足迹是一件美妙的事情；在一个交通运输已经成为经济命脉超过 2000 年的国家，装载汽车出发上路似乎再合适不过了。 The Toktogul Reservoir © Hill and Aubrey托克托古尔水库 © 希尔与奥布里 We’d arrived in the capital, Bishkek, earlier that morning and immediately embarked on the 12-hour drive to Kyrgyzstan’s southern capital, Osh. First we crossed the&nbsp;mountains, or more specifically, passed through them. Kyrgyzstan is mountainous, with 94 per cent of its territory&nbsp;sitting above an altitude of 1,000m. We sat patiently in dark tunnels. The only light came from industrial lamps that glistened off dust kicked up by roadworks and illuminated the way for the herds of sheep, cattle and horses. At this time of year, shepherds move&nbsp;their flocks to&nbsp;high pastures to avoid the searing heat of the&nbsp;lower&nbsp;plains. We waited, competing with animals for&nbsp;space while sitting in the inky light.我们早上到达了首都比什凯克，立即开始了前往吉尔吉斯斯坦南部首府奥什的 12 小时车程。首先我们穿越了山脉，或者更确切地说，是通过了山脉。吉尔吉斯斯坦多山，94%的国土面积位于海拔 1000 米以上。我们耐心地坐在黑暗的隧道里。唯一的光线来自于工业灯，它们在道路施工激起的尘土中闪烁，并为羊群、牛群和马群照亮了前行的道路。在这个时候，牧羊人将他们的羊群转移到高山牧场，以避免低平原上灼热的酷暑。我们等待着，在墨黑的光线中与动物们争夺空间。 As the tunnels gave way to the vast peaks and lakes of the country’s interior, Zamir talked about his country’s nomadic history and its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. During the Soviet era he had been in the army before becoming a teacher, and had learned English from audio cassettes. Huge brutalist monuments announcing the various regions of the country towered over us as motorways made way for rural roads. We stopped for Russian ice lollies and cigarettes while the car was filled up with foul-smelling gas (a cheaper alternative to petrol in this part of the&nbsp;world). We slept when we could, as we trundled past yurts that sat in the basins separating us from the mountains; flecks of white canvas against the bowling-lawn green of the steppe.随着隧道向国内广阔的山峰和湖泊敞开，扎米尔谈起了他的国家游牧的历史以及 1991 年从苏联独立。在苏联时代，他曾在军队服役，后来成为一名教师，并通过音频磁带学会了英语。巨大的野蛮主义纪念碑宣告着国家各个区域的边界，高耸在我们头顶，随着高速公路让位给乡村道路。我们停下来买俄罗斯冰棍和香烟，同时汽车加满了味道难闻的气体（在这个地区是比汽油更便宜的替代品）。我们尽可能地睡觉，因为我们颠簸着经过分隔我们和山脉的盆地里的毡房；白色帆布的斑点点缀在草原的保龄球场绿色之中。 The new mosque in&nbsp;Osh © Hill and Aubrey奥什山新清真寺 © Hill 和 Aubrey We arrived in Osh late and woke early. It felt like the city of the wandering traveller. Continuously inhabited for around 3,000 years, it is one of the oldest cities in central Asia, attracting Kyrgyz traders as well as Uzbeks and Tajiks to buy and sell their goods in the huge bazaar that dominates the centre. Sulaiman-Too, a Muslim pilgrimage site, overlooks it. About halfway up you are encouraged to spend a surreal hour in the local museum. Ernst Stavro Blofeld would be impressed by the building, a feat of Soviet engineering carved into the side of the mountain where you can learn about Kyrgyzstan’s prehistoric past.我们晚间抵达奥什，一早醒来。这座城市给人一种流浪旅人的感觉。奥什连续有人居住约 3000 年，是中亚最古老的城市之一，吸引了吉尔吉斯商人以及乌兹别克人和塔吉克人来到这里的巨大集市中买卖货物，该集市主宰着市中心。穆斯林朝圣地苏莱曼山俯瞰着这一切。大约在山腰处，你会被鼓励在当地博物馆度过一个超现实的小时。恩斯特·斯塔夫罗·布洛菲尔德会对这座建筑印象深刻，这是苏联工程的壮举，雕刻在山侧，你可以在那里了解吉尔吉斯斯坦的史前时期。 We picked our way up the polished steps and admired the view of the city below, making our way past women whispering incantations and performing quiet, shaman-like rituals – ancient practices subtly infused with those of the country’s majority-Muslim population. The early afternoon was spent wandering the bazaar, kitting ourselves out in the local handmade waistcoats and traditional Ak-kalpak hat so popular among Kyrgyz men. We ate wurut – savoury snacks made&nbsp;from salty fermented cow’s milk that are a challenge for the western palate – and drank Soviet cola mixed in front of us by a man in a lab coat as children bought candy floss, paying with ticket stubs for Soviet-era fun-fair rides.&nbsp;我们沿着光滑的台阶拾级而上，欣赏着下方城市的景色，一路经过低声念咒、进行着宁静的、类似萨满仪式的女人们——古老的实践巧妙地融合了这个国家大多数穆斯林人口的习俗。初午时分，我们漫步于集市，为自己配上了当地手工制作的背心和在吉尔吉斯男性中颇为流行的传统 Ak-kalpak 帽。我们吃了 wurut——由咸味发酵牛奶制成的咸味小吃，对西方人的味蕾来说颇具挑战性——并喝了由一位穿实验室大衣的男子当场调制的苏维埃可乐，而孩子们则买着棉花糖，用苏联时代游乐场的票根付款。 That evening, we headed for Arslanbob, an Uzbek enclave in the foothills of the Babash Ata mountain range,&nbsp;where livelihoods revolve around the annual harvest of its main attraction: the world’s largest walnut forest. I sank like a stone into a deep wooden cot of eiderdown and woollen blankets in our little guesthouse.&nbsp;When I woke there was a cool humidity in the air and the rustling of leaves outside the window. I&nbsp;opened the curtain to a lush vista of trees waving softly&nbsp;in the breeze. The arid dust of the low country had again been replaced with something from an alpine postcard. I&nbsp;wandered across the courtyard to a table of homemade jams, freshly churned butter, bread and local honey that&nbsp;had been prepared for us.&nbsp;那天晚上，我们前往位于巴巴什阿塔山脉山麓的乌兹别克飞地阿尔斯兰波布，那里的生计依赖于每年一度的主要吸引力：世界上最大的核桃林的收成。我沉重地倒在我们小客栈里的一张深木床上，床上铺着鸭绒和羊毛毯。醒来时，空气中有一丝凉爽的湿润和窗外树叶的沙沙声。我拉开窗帘，眼前是树木在微风中轻轻摇曳的郁郁葱葱的景象。低洼地区的干燥尘土再次被阿尔卑斯明信片上的景象所取代。我漫步穿过院子，来到一张桌子前，桌上摆放着为我们准备的自制果酱、新鲜搅拌的黄油、面包和当地蜂蜜。 In mid-morning we took a jeep into the mountains, and in the heat of the day we hiked past waterfalls and rice fields. Birds darted in and out of the spray as we peered into the mist below. By late afternoon we’d arrived at the forest; I had a strange and sudden feeling of homesickness as we moved quietly under the canopy of trees: we could have been in the New&nbsp;Forest. It was uncanny. Our guide proudly regaled us with local legends of ancient treasure supposedly hidden under the waterfall, how the people of these parts are the apparent descendants of Alexander the Great, and that, remarkably,&nbsp;Winston Churchill is said to have traded weapons for walnut wood to produce the dashboards of Rolls-Royces during the war.&nbsp;上午我们乘吉普车进入山区，在一天中最热的时候，我们沿着瀑布和稻田徒步行走。鸟儿在水花中快速穿梭，我们凝视着下方的薄雾。到了傍晚，我们抵达了森林；当我们静静地在树冠下移动时，我突然有了一种强烈的思乡之情：感觉就像在新森林一样。这感觉真是神奇。我们的向导自豪地向我们讲述了当地的传说，古代宝藏据说就藏在瀑布下，这些地方的人显然是亚历山大大帝的后代，而且，令人惊讶的是，据说温斯顿·丘吉尔在战争期间曾用武器交换核桃木，用来制造劳斯莱斯汽车的仪表板。 A Soviet-era road marker © Hill and Aubrey苏联时代的道路标记 © Hill 和 Aubrey The thick trees eventually opened up into a large clearing where families had gathered for a meal. We sat and watched as children were winched up in giant swings&nbsp;and catapulted, screaming with excitement, into&nbsp;the air. Food was prepared; people sat on cushions in&nbsp;raised huts as the sun began&nbsp;to&nbsp;dip below the horizon. We rested for a while&nbsp;before we had to leave this little&nbsp;Eden&nbsp;and&nbsp;start down the mountain, to&nbsp;get back on the road.&nbsp;茂密的树木最终敞开，露出一个大空地，那里聚集了许多家庭准备用餐。我们坐下来观看孩子们被吊到巨大的秋千上，然后尖叫着兴奋地被弹射到空中。食物被准备好了；人们坐在升高的小屋里的垫子上，太阳开始沉到地平线下。我们在这个小伊甸园里休息了一会儿，然后不得不离开，开始下山，回到路上。 The next day we stopped to buy honey.&nbsp;A large man perched on a donkey came to investigate, a lady in a purple jumpsuit milked a mare and a curious family holidaying from the capital invited&nbsp;us inside their yurt. Inside the tent&nbsp;a child lay sleeping on a mattress bathed in soft light from the hole in the top. Outside we drank milk, sweet and delicious, with our new friends.&nbsp;第二天我们停下来买蜂蜜。一个骑在驴背上的大个子男人过来看看，一个穿着紫色连身衣的女士在挤母马的奶，一个来自首都的好奇家庭邀请我们进入他们的毡房。在帐篷里，一个孩子躺在被顶部洞口柔和光线照射的床垫上睡觉。外面我们和新朋友一起喝着甜美可口的牛奶。 The changing of the guard in Bishkek © Hill and Aubrey比什凯克卫兵交接仪式 © 希尔与奥布里 We finished our trip in Bishkek, where grid systems and military parades still evoke the faded pomp of the Soviet era. As we entered the capital, the topic of conversation turned to religion, and Zamir said: “My religion is the USSR.” His comment contains a note of irony. This is a country still trying to find a balance between&nbsp;its nomadic heritage, its recent history and its potential as a shining liberal democracy of central Asia –&nbsp;the crucible of access between vying continents. It occurred to me that on the side of a road, you can experience all this in the gentle hospitality of a single family.我们的旅行在比什凯克结束，那里的网格系统和军事阅兵仍然让人回想起苏联时代褪色的华丽。当我们进入首都，谈话的话题转向了宗教，扎米尔说：“我的宗教是苏联。”他的评论带有讽刺意味。这是一个国家，仍在试图在其游牧传统、近期历史以及作为中亚闪亮的自由民主国家的潜力之间找到平衡——它是争夺大陆之间通路的熔炉。我意识到，在路边，你可以在一个家庭的温柔好客中体验到这一切。 Kyrgyzstan has always been a crossroad, cultural and geographical. I thought about our little caravan heading due south.
